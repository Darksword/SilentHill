Noelle...you're alive...but how? 
Why did you let me burn Wilson, look at me!
I... I tried my best. I'm sorry.
Sorry! Sorry!? Sorry doesn't change what happened! You never cared of anyone but yourself. 
That's not true Noelle...I risked my life for you that day.
No...No you didn't. Or else I wouldn't be black and covered in ash. It's your turn Wilson...
I felt the pain of flames scorching my flesh. Now you shall as well.
Noelle...No!
Prepare to suffer, as you made me.
